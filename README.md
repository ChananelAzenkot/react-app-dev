# Contact Book
    PContact book apps allow users to store and organize contact
    information on their mobile devices. They provide features like
    adding names, phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses,
    photos, and notes for each contact. Some apps sync contacts
    across devices and back them up to the cloud. Contact books help
    keep important contact info organized and easily accessible on a
    smartphone or tablet.

## So what can we do and how is works ?

    Contact book apps allow users to add new contacts by entering
    their name, phone number, email address, and other info. Users
    can view and scroll through their list of contacts, search for
    specific contacts, and tap on a contact to see their details.
    Apps allow calling, messaging, or emailing contacts directly
    from their profile. Users can create different contact groups
    and organize contacts however they prefer. Some key features are
    adding, viewing, searching, communicating with, and organizing
    contacts from one central app.
